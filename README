Dear GRACES user,
Thank you for your interest in the pipeline DRAGRACES. 
Please, feel free to modify it to your taste.

PREREQUISITES:

 - IDL (only tested under IDL 8+)
 - Astrolib (http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftp/)
 - imdisp.pro (https://www.idlcoyote.com/programs/coyoteplus/imdisp.pro)
     . if you do no want imdisp, simply comment line 955
 note1: make sure that Astrolib and imdisp are copied into your IDL libraries
 note2: a future release will also contain an executable that can be ran without
        an IDL licence!

PROGRAMME NAME AND SUBROUTINES

program name: dg
subroutines:  overs_corr
              find_trace
              find_lines
              reduce
              extract
              wavel_sol
              wavel_cal
The pipeline and all the subroutines are in the same .pro file, i.e., "dg.pro".

HOW TO RUN IT

1. Move or copy all the data of a given night with associated calibrations files
   to the same diectory. Make sure no other files from other nights are in the
   same directory. (There are ways to handle data from multiple nights, but they
   are not fully tested yet; see below the optional inputs.)
2. Run IDL and compile "dg.pro":
       IDL> .r dg
3. Type "dg". If the pipeline is in the same directory as the data, you do not 
   need to provide any input. If it is not, use the optional input "dir" to give
   the path to the data. E.g.:
       IDL> dg,dir='/home/myaccount/myproject/mydata/20150721/'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF DG.PRO OPTIONS

    CALLING SEQUENCE:
      dg[,dir=dir,utdate=utdate,lbias=lbias,lflat=lflat,lthar=lthar,/skip_wavel,/ascii_file,/new,/help]
      
    INPUTS (all optional):
         dir - Path to where the data can be found. A new directory named "Reduction" will
               be created, if it does not already exist.
      utdate - Date when the spectra where observed. The format is YYYYMMDD, and can be
               given as a number (without ''). If it not provided, it is expected that the
               data in the directory pointed by the input "dir" are all from the same date. 
       lbias - Name of a file where the bias frames are listed.
       lflat - Name of a file where the flats frames are listed.
       lthar - Name of a file where the ThAr frames are listed.
  skip_wavel - When provided, the wavelength solution is not calculated.
  ascii_file - (NOT YET WORKING)
         new - Forces DRAGRACES to recalculate all the calibrations instead of using those
               obtained in a previous run of the pipeline
        logo - Displays the DRAGRACES logo when you run the pipeline!
        help - Displays this help summary.
    OUTPUTS:
      The program saves the extracted spectra in the fits format, in the directory "Reduction".
      If the wavelength solution was calculated, the filenames start with "ext_". If not, 
      the filenames start with "red_", and an additional "red_Thar_..." spectrum is provided.

HOW TO SUBMIT BUGS AND REQUESTS

Very important: DO NOT SUBMIT A GEMINI HELPDESK TICKET.
If you want to report a problem, use the Gemini Data Reduction Forum thread where the pipeline
is shared to post it.

FUTURE IMPROVMENTS

1. There is no rejection method used to create the Master calibrations files.
   A future release should include rejections techniques, such as minmax or
   sigma-clipping.
2. There is no rejection method used when the spectra are extracted. A future
   release should include cosmic ray rejections.
3. The interpolation dealing with the trace curvature AND the slit tilt is
   a linear interpolation. It does an OK job, but is causing some artifacts
   near the edges of the traces. A future release should deal with that better.
4. Each order contains 4640 pixels. However, the optical resolution elements
   are slightly undersampled. Thanks to the slit tilt, we can reconstruct a
   little better the optical resolution elements. A future release will
   interpolate better the optical resolution elements.
